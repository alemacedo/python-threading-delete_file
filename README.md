# About
 I was having some trouble with a lots of "desktop.ini" files that was auto generated by Google Drive app in my PC.
 So I wrote this simple code to delete them in a given folder.
 And as it took some time to scan some folders, I had given a try in multi threading stuff, so I can see the program still running.
